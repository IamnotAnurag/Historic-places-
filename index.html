                The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the Yamuna river in the
                Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, to house the
                tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The Taj
                Mahal is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and is a UNESCO
                World Heritage Site.

                The Ellora Caves are a series of rock-cut caves located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra,
                India. They are known for their unique architecture, which represents a fusion of Hindu, Buddhist,
                and Jain traditions. The caves were carved out of basaltic rock during the 6th to 10th centuries
                and contain elaborate sculptures, frescoes, and carvings. The Ellora Caves are a UNESCO World
                Heritage Site and are a testament to the rich cultural heritage of India.
